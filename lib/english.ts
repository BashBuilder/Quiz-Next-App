            "Use the passage to answer the questions below<br>\nRead the passage carefully and answer the questions that follow:<br>\n<br>\nThe victory of the small Greek democracy of Athens over the mighty Persian Empire was furious because Athens had interceded for the other Greek city-states in revolt against Persian domination. In anger, the king sent an enormous army to defeat Athens. He thought it would take drastic steps to pacify the rebellious part of the empire.<br>\n<br>\nPersia was ruled by one man. In Athens, however, all citiens helped to rule. Emboldened&nbsp;by this participation, Athenians were prepared to die for their city-state. Perhaps this was the secret of the remarkable victory at the marathon, the Persians tried to fool some Greek city-states by claiming to have come in peace. The frightened city of Delos refused to believe this. Not wanting to abet the conquest of Greece, they fled from their city and did not return until the Persians had left. They were wise, for the president next conquered the city of Eritrea and captured its people.<br>\n<br>\nTiny&nbsp;Athens stood alone against Persia. The Athenian people to their sanctuaries. There they prayed for deliverance. They asked their gods to expedite their victory. The Athenians refurbished their weapons and moved to the plan of Marathon where their little band would meet the Persians. At the last moment, soldiers from Plataea reinforced the Athenian troops.<br>\n<br>\nThe Athenian army attacked and Greek citizens fought bravely. The power of the mighty Persians was offset by the love that the Athenians had for their city. Athenians defeated the Persians in both archery and combat. Greek soldiers seized Persian sheep&nbsp;and burned them and the Persians fled in terror. Herodotus, a famous historian, reports that 6400 Persians died, compared to only 192 Athenians.",
