But today, the situation is different. Theatre is becoming very unpopular.&nbsp;Africa of the present age is pre-occupied with many problems yearning for immediate solutions. The continent is facing hydra-head challenges - challenges on the political, social, and economic scenes. In a world where Science and Technology are seen as the solutions to these problems, little attention is paid to the arts.

Many Africa today look at drama and theatre&nbsp;as a mere thing of fun, a joke so to say.&nbsp;Elitism is another barrier that militates against the appreciation of theatre&nbsp;as a communal art. Folk&nbsp;theatre is appreciated by a negligible number of people, contemporary focus is on literary theatre. Unfortunately, literary theatre only pretends to serve the interest of its society while in reality, it has a foreign audience in mind. The use of European and American theatrical&nbsp;conventions by our academic playwrights can bear witness to this anomaly.&nbsp;The popularity of the literary African theatre is further marred by the medium of communication as most literary dramas in Africa are written in foreign languages which are not understood by many Africans.
